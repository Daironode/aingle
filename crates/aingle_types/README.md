Common types used by other AIngle crates.

This crate is a complement to the [aingle_zome_types crate](https://crates.io/crates/aingle_zome_types), which contains only the essential types which are used in AIngle SAF code. This crate expands on those types to include all types which AIngle itself depends on.
