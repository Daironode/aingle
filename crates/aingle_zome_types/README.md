zome_types provides the types needed by AIngle application developers in their zome code, nothing more.

This crate is intentionally kept as minimal as possible, since it is typically included as a dependency in AIngle Zomes, which are distributed as chunks of Wasm. In contrast, the [aingle_types crate](https://crates.io/crates/aingle_types) contains more types which are used by AIngle itself.
